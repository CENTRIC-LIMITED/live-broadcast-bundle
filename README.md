## About

The Live Broadcast Bundle will make it possible to plan live video streams to
various websites/apps like Twitch, YouTube Live, Facebook Live.

You are able to stream from various inputs. This package supports files, URL's or existing RTMP streams.

## Prerequisites

To test these prerequisites the Symfony command `livebroadcaster:test:shell` can be used after the installation described below.
If you like to check this manually the Broadcaster needs a few commands on an operating system;

All OS's:
* `ffmpeg 3.x or higher`

On Linux:
* `ps`
* `kill`

On Mac:
* `ps`
* `grep`
* `kill`

On Windows:
* `tasklist`
* `taskkill`

## Basic installation

This bundle is available on Packagist. You can then install it using Composer:

```bash
$ composer require martin1982/live-broadcast-bundle
```

Use Doctrine to update your database schema with the broadcasting entities, when upgrading it is recommended to use migrations.

To start the broadcast scheduler you can run the following command:

```bash
$ php bin/console livebroadcaster:broadcast
```

To run the scheduler as a long-running process it's recommended to use the messenger middleware to keep the database
connection alive as described at https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html

### FFMpeg log directory
To view the output of FFMpeg you need to configure a log directory in your `config/packages/live_broadcast.yaml`.
 
     live_broadcast:
        ffmpeg:
            log_directory: '%kernel.logs_dir%'

### Event loop
You can use this configuration to set the event loop timer:

    live_broadcast:
        eventloop:
            timer: 5

### Thumbnailer setup
Set up the following config for thumbnails:
    
    live_broadcast:
        thumbnail:
            upload_directory: '%kernel.project_dir%/public/uploads/thumbnails'
            web_path: '/uploads/thumbnails'

## Enabling Facebook Live
Create a Facebook app on https://developers.facebook.com with the following permissions:

- user_videos
- user_events
- user_managed_groups
- manage_pages
- publish_actions
- Live-Video API

Edit your `config/packages/live_broadcast.yaml` with the following configuration:

    live_broadcast:
        facebook:
            application_id: YourFacebookAppId
            application_secret: YourFacebookAppSecret

## Enabling YouTube Live

Login to https://console.developers.google.com/ and enable the 'YouTube Data API v3'.

Add the YouTube API info to your config.yml:

    live_broadcast:
        youtube:
            client_id: YourGoogleOauthClientId
            client_secret: YourGoogleOauthClientSecret
              
Add these lines to your parameters.yml (used for generating a thumbnail URL)

    parameters:
        router.request_context.host: broadcast.com
        router.request_context.scheme: https
    
## Add new output platforms

Create a new Channel Entity in Entity/Channel that extends the AbstractChannel (e.g. ChannelNew)

Create a new StreamOutput service in Service/StreamOutput that implements the OutputInterface (e.g. OutputNew)

Configure the service with the output tag in config/services.yml

    live.broadcast.output.new:
        class: Martin1982\LiveBroadcastBundle\Service\StreamOutput\OutputNew
        tags:
            - { name: live.broadcast.output, platform: 'New' }

## Using an admin GUI

This bundle comes without a web frontend interface, to make use of an admin package you can pick the one to your liking;
* Sonata Admin: https://github.com/Martin1982/live-broadcast-sonata-admin-bundle
* Easyadmin: https://github.com/Martin1982/live-broadcast-easyadmin-bundle
